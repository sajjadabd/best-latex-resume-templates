\section*{Experience}

\subsection*{Senior Clojure Engineer at Splash Financial \hfill March 2022 -- Present}

Work on Clojure microservices to automate underwriting loans.

\tag{Clojure} \tag{Bazel} \tag{PostgreSQL} \tag{AWS} \tag{Terraform}

\subsection*{Cloud Engineer at IronNet \hfill March 2019 -- March 2022}

As a member of the \textbf{\textsl{Cloud Infrastructure}} team at IronNet, I
helped oversee cloud-related endeavors and develop internal tooling. Some
things that I personally worked on:

\begin{itemize}
\item Designed and implemented a new data-ingest pipeline that leverages AWS
  managed services (like ALB, Kinesis, and ECS) in order to be more scalable and
  reliable than previous designs.
\item Created and improved various internal tooling (mostly in Python) for
  things like:

  \begin{multicols}{2}
    \raggedright
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Managing Kubernetes clusters
    \item Deploying applications (usually to Kubernetes)
    \item Creating AWS accounts
    \item Maintaining cross-account permissions
    \item Leveraging AWS spot instances
    \end{itemize}
  \end{multicols}

\end{itemize}

\tag{Python} \tag{Go} \tag{Bash} \tag{Kubernetes} \tag{helm} \tag{AWS}
\tag{Azure} \tag{Terraform}

\subsection*{QA Engineer at Fugue \hfill Jul 2015 -- Jan 2019}

The QA team was in charge of designing and implementing a test harness for Fugue
(which at the time was a platform for defining, creating, and monitoring
infrastructure in AWS and Azure, sort of like Terraform). I created much of this
system, as well as a variety of general-purpose internal tooling.

\begin{itemize}
\item Helped design and create an end-to-end test harness for Fugue (Python,
  Bash, Go)
\item Wrote a utility for completely clearing AWS accounts (Python)
\item Created an automated pipeline for building test VMs in AWS and Azure
  (Ansible, Packer, Go, Azure Resource Manager)
\item Created CI builds in Travis and Concourse
\item Devised a literate-programming approach for running and documenting tests
\end{itemize}

\tag{Python} \tag{Bash} \tag{Clojure} \tag{Go} \tag{Haskell} \tag{AWS}
\tag{Azure} \tag{Ansible} \tag{Packer} \tag{Concourse}

\subsection*{Web Developer at Wells Fargo \hfill Feb 2015 -- Jul 2015}

Member of a small team creating an internal auditing and task-tracking
application.

\tag{Java} \tag{Spring} \tag{Hibernate} \tag{YUI} \tag{Javascript}

\subsection*{Startup Entrepreneur \hfill May 2014 -- Jan 2015}

I \textit{really} wanted to create my own business. It was primarily focused on
two business ventures:

\begin{itemize}
\item Worked with a medical clinic to create a web application that helped
  provide communication between doctors, patients, nurses, and call center
  operators.

\item Partnered with another small team to build a recruiting platform for
  high-level executives.
\end{itemize}

\tag{MEAN stack} \tag{Docker} \tag{Java 8} \tag{Scala} \tag{MySQL} \tag{Bash}
\tag{\LaTeX}

\subsection*{Consultant at Red Hat \hfill Aug 2011 -- May 2014}

I traveled to client sites and worked on a variety of projects. Mostly, this
involved integrating the JBoss suite of products which Red Hat had recently
acquired.

\tag{Java} \tag{JBoss} \tag{JBoss Rules} \tag{jBPM} \tag{Hibernate}
